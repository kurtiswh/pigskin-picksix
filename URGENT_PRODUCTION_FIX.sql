-- URGENT: Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies for users table
-- Run this immediately in Supabase SQL Editor to fix CSV upload issues
-- The 500 errors are caused by policies that check admin status by querying the users table they're protecting

-- Step 1: Drop all existing problematic policies on users table
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own data" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view all users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can manage users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view all profiles" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update any profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow user creation during signup" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "anonymous_read_users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_read_users" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "users_update_own" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "allow_user_insert" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "service_role_all_access" ON public.users;

-- Step 2: Create simple, non-recursive policies
-- Allow anonymous read access (needed for email validation and CSV uploads)
CREATE POLICY "anonymous_read_users" ON public.users
    FOR SELECT TO anon
    USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to read all profiles (needed for LeagueSafe uploads)
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_read_users" ON public.users
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (true);

-- Allow users to update their own profile only
CREATE POLICY "users_update_own" ON public.users
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow user creation during signup/CSV upload (without admin checks)
CREATE POLICY "allow_user_insert" ON public.users
    FOR INSERT TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow service role full access (for admin operations)
CREATE POLICY "service_role_all_access" ON public.users
    FOR ALL TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Step 3: Fix LeagueSafe payments policies too
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admin users can manage leaguesafe payments" ON public.leaguesafe_payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "authenticated_read_leaguesafe" ON public.leaguesafe_payments;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "service_role_leaguesafe_all" ON public.leaguesafe_payments;

-- Create simple LeagueSafe policies
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_read_leaguesafe" ON public.leaguesafe_payments
    FOR SELECT TO authenticated
    USING (true);

CREATE POLICY "authenticated_write_leaguesafe" ON public.leaguesafe_payments
    FOR INSERT TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "authenticated_update_leaguesafe" ON public.leaguesafe_payments
    FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

CREATE POLICY "service_role_leaguesafe_all" ON public.leaguesafe_payments
    FOR ALL TO service_role
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Step 4: Add helper function for admin checks (used by app, not RLS)
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.is_user_admin(user_id UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN
LANGUAGE sql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
    SELECT COALESCE(is_admin, false) FROM public.users WHERE id = user_id;
$$;

-- Grant execute permission
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.is_user_admin(UUID) TO authenticated;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION public.is_user_admin(UUID) TO anon;

-- Add comment explaining the fix
COMMENT ON TABLE public.users IS 'RLS policies simplified to avoid infinite recursion. Admin checks now done at application level using is_user_admin() function. Fixed CSV upload 500 errors.';

-- Test query to verify fix works
SELECT 'RLS_FIX_APPLIED_SUCCESSFULLY' as status, 
       COUNT(*) as user_count 
FROM public.users 
LIMIT 1;
