# Workflow Test Results

## Test: Complete Unsave → Re-edit → Re-save Workflow

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Select games**: Games appear in UI with full details (rankings, venue, etc.)
2. **Save games**: Games committed to database, UI state preserved
3. **Unsave games**: Games removed from database, UI selection preserved for editing
4. **Re-edit games**: Can swap/modify selections while preserving details
5. **Re-save games**: New selection committed to database

### Critical Fix Applied:
- Fixed `syncSelectedGamesWithAvailable` function in `AdminDashboard.tsx:580-600`
- Changed from `...matching` to `...selected` to preserve original game data
- Only updates essential fields (ID, start_date) while keeping rankings, venue, etc.

### Code Fix:
```typescript
return {
  ...selected, // Keep all original data including rankings, venue, etc.
  id: matching.id, // Update ID to match available games
  start_date: matching.start_date || selected.start_date,
  spread: selected.spread || matching.spread,
}
```

### Test Status: READY FOR USER TESTING
- Development server running on localhost:5173
- Fix deployed and active
- User should test the complete workflow to confirm game details persist

### Files Modified:
- `src/pages/AdminDashboard.tsx` - Fixed sync function to preserve game details
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging sync operations
