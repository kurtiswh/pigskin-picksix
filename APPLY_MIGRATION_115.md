# üîß URGENT: Apply Migration 115 - Add Missing Columns to Anonymous Picks

## Problem
The anonymous_picks table is missing the `result` and `points_earned` columns that the pick processing system is trying to update. This causes the pick processing to fail silently for anonymous picks.

## Root Cause
The `anonymous_picks` table was created without the scoring columns that exist in the `picks` table:
- ‚ùå `result` column is missing (needed to store 'win', 'loss', 'push', 'pending')
- ‚ùå `points_earned` column is missing (needed to store calculated points)

## Solution: Apply Migration 115

### Step 1: Copy Migration SQL
```sql
-- Migration: Add missing result and points_earned columns to anonymous_picks table
-- These columns are needed for the pick processing system to update anonymous picks

-- Add the missing columns that exist in the picks table
ALTER TABLE public.anonymous_picks 
ADD COLUMN result TEXT CHECK (result IN ('win', 'loss', 'push', 'pending'));

ALTER TABLE public.anonymous_picks 
ADD COLUMN points_earned INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Add index for performance when querying by result
CREATE INDEX idx_anonymous_picks_result ON public.anonymous_picks(result);

-- Add comments for clarity
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.anonymous_picks.result IS 'Pick result: win, loss, push, or pending';
COMMENT ON COLUMN public.anonymous_picks.points_earned IS 'Points earned for this pick (20 for win, 10 for lock win, 0 for loss/push)';
```

### Step 2: Apply Migration
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor ‚Üí New Query
2. Paste the entire SQL above
3. Execute the migration
4. Verify no errors in the output

### Step 3: Test the Fix
After applying the migration, test the picks scoring system:
1. Go to Admin Dashboard ‚Üí Score Manager
2. Click "Update Picks Scoring" 
3. Anonymous picks should now be processed and updated

### Step 4: Fix Leaderboard Constraint Violations
The leaderboard functions also need updating. Apply this additional fix:

```sql
-- Update the leaderboard functions to handle anonymous picks correctly
-- The issue is that anonymous_picks don't have season/week columns directly

## Expected Results
‚úÖ **BEFORE**: Anonymous picks not updating, constraint violations on leaderboard  
‚úÖ **AFTER**: Anonymous picks process correctly, leaderboards update without errors

## Key Changes Made
1. **Added Missing Columns**: `result` and `points_earned` to `anonymous_picks` table
2. **Simplified Anonymous Pick Processing**: Now uses direct columns instead of calculated values
3. **Fixed Leaderboard JOIN Logic**: Anonymous picks join through games table to get week/season
4. **Maintained UPSERT Logic**: Constraint violations should be handled gracefully

## Testing Steps
1. Apply Migration 115 
2. Run scheduled pick processing
3. Verify anonymous picks show updated results and points
4. Check leaderboards refresh without constraint errors
