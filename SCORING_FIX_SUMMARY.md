# Scoring Fix Summary - Single Source of Truth

## Problem Solved

**Issue**: Live scoring was calculating game winners incorrectly, requiring manual admin fixes.

**Root Cause**: Three different winner calculation implementations that didn't match:
1. ‚úÖ **Database function** `calculate_winner_against_spread()` (CORRECT)
2. ‚ùå **Edge Function** `calculateWinner()` with `Math.abs()` tolerance (WRONG)
3. ‚ùå **TypeScript services** duplicate logic with same bug (WRONG)

**The Bug**:
```typescript
// WRONG (Edge Function & TypeScript):
if (Math.abs(homeMargin + spread) < 0.5) winner = 'push'

// CORRECT (Database):
home_score_with_spread := home_score + spread
IF home_score_with_spread > away_score THEN RETURN home_team
ELSIF away_score > home_score_with_spread THEN RETURN away_team
ELSE RETURN 'push'
```

The `Math.abs(...) < 0.5` adds a 0.5-point tolerance for pushes that doesn't exist in the database logic, causing incorrect winner determination.

## Solution Implemented

### New Single Source of Truth Function

**Created**: `calculate_and_update_completed_game(game_id)` in migration 139

This ONE database function now:
1. ‚úÖ Calculates winner using database source of truth (`calculate_winner_against_spread`)
2. ‚úÖ Calculates margin bonus correctly
3. ‚úÖ Updates game record (winner, bonus, base points)
4. ‚úÖ Processes ALL picks (regular + anonymous)
5. ‚úÖ Returns comprehensive result

**Benefits**:
- Single source of truth - no more duplicate logic
- Matches manual admin fix exactly
- Atomic database transaction
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Used by BOTH automated systems AND manual triggers

## Files Changed

### 1. Database Migration (New)
**File**: `database/migrations/139_single_source_of_truth_scoring.sql`

- Created consolidated `calculate_and_update_completed_game()` function
- Reuses existing `calculate_winner_against_spread()` for winner logic
- Reuses existing `process_picks_for_completed_game()` for pick processing
- Granted permissions to `authenticated` and `service_role`

### 2. Edge Function (Updated)
**File**: `supabase/functions/live-score-updater/index.ts`

**Changes**:
- ‚ùå Removed local `calculateWinner()` function (lines 369-390)
- ‚úÖ Now calls `calculate_and_update_completed_game()` RPC
- ‚úÖ Updated pick processing logic to use database results
- Game updates now only set scores/status, database calculates winner

### 3. TypeScript Service (Updated)
**File**: `src/services/cfbdLiveUpdater.ts`

**Changes**:
- ‚ùå Removed local `calculateWinner()` method
- ‚ùå Removed winner calculation in `calculateUpdateData()`
- ‚úÖ Now calls `calculate_and_update_completed_game()` RPC after game update
- ‚úÖ Logs database-calculated winner and pick results

### 4. Live Update Service (No Changes Needed)
**File**: `src/services/liveUpdateService.ts`

- Already calls `CFBDLiveUpdater.updateLiveGames()`
- Automatically uses new database function via cfbdLiveUpdater
- No changes required ‚úÖ

## How It Works Now

### Flow for Completed Games:

1. **CFBD API Fetch**: Edge Function or TypeScript fetches live scores
2. **Game Update**: Updates only scores, status, quarter, clock
3. **Database Scoring** (NEW): Calls `calculate_and_update_completed_game()`
   - Database calculates winner (single source of truth)
   - Database calculates margin bonus
   - Database updates game record
   - Database processes ALL picks
   - Returns success/error + stats
4. **Result Logging**: Logs winner, bonus, picks processed

### Before vs After:

**BEFORE**:
```typescript
// Edge Function or TypeScript calculates winner locally (WRONG)
const winner = calculateWinner(home, away, homeScore, awayScore, spread)
updates.winner_against_spread = winner.winner  // ‚ùå Incorrect logic
updates.margin_bonus = winner.marginBonus

// Then separately processes picks
await supabase.rpc('process_picks_for_completed_game', {...})
```

**AFTER**:
```typescript
// Update game scores/status only
await supabase.from('games').update({ home_score, away_score, status })

// Database does ALL scoring with single source of truth ‚úÖ
const { data } = await supabase.rpc('calculate_and_update_completed_game', {
  game_id_param: gameId
})
// Returns: winner, margin_bonus, picks_updated, success
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Deploy Migration
```bash
# Run in Supabase SQL Editor or via migration
# This creates calculate_and_update_completed_game() function
```

### 2. Redeploy Edge Function (if using automated scoring)
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy live-score-updater
```

### 3. Test Manual Scoring
In Admin Dashboard:
1. Find a completed game with incorrect winner
2. Click "Fix Scoring"
3. Verify it uses `calculate_and_update_completed_game()`
4. Check that winner matches expected result

### 4. Test Live Scoring
1. Wait for next game to complete
2. Check Edge Function logs in Supabase
3. Verify logs show: `‚úÖ Winner: [team], Bonus: [X]`
4. Verify picks are processed: `‚úÖ Picks processed: X picks`
5. **Most Important**: Verify winner matches manual calculation

### 5. Verify Consistency
```sql
-- Check a game's scoring
SELECT
  home_team,
  away_team,
  home_score,
  away_score,
  spread,
  winner_against_spread,
  margin_bonus
FROM games
WHERE id = 'game-id-here';

-- Recalculate using database function
SELECT * FROM calculate_and_update_completed_game('game-id-here');

-- Both should return IDENTICAL winner and bonus!
```

---

## Monitoring & Debugging

### Check Edge Function Logs
```
Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí Edge Functions ‚Üí live-score-updater ‚Üí Logs

Look for:
‚úÖ "Winner: [team], Bonus: [X]"
‚úÖ "Picks processed: X picks, X anonymous picks"
‚ùå "Scoring failed: [error]"
```

### Check Database Function Output
```sql
-- Run database function manually
SELECT * FROM calculate_and_update_completed_game('game-id');

-- Check notices in logs:
üéØ [SCORING] Processing completed game
üìä Game: AWAY @ HOME (X-Y)
üìè Spread: -X.X
‚úÖ HOME team covers: score + spread = total > away_score
üìä HOME cover margin: X points ‚Üí Bonus: X
‚úÖ Game updated: winner=TEAM, bonus=X, base=20
‚úÖ Picks processed: X regular, X anonymous
üéâ SCORING COMPLETE
```

### Verify Pick Results
```sql
-- Check if picks were scored correctly
SELECT
  u.display_name,
  p.selected_team,
  p.is_lock,
  p.result,
  p.points_earned,
  g.winner_against_spread,
  g.margin_bonus
FROM picks p
JOIN users u ON p.user_id = u.id
JOIN games g ON p.game_id = g.id
WHERE g.id = 'game-id'
ORDER BY p.points_earned DESC;
```

## Expected Behavior

### Correct Scoring Examples:

**Example 1: Home Team Covers**
- Game: Alabama @ Georgia
- Final: 31-24 (Georgia)
- Spread: Georgia -3.5
- Calculation: 31 + (-3.5) = 27.5 < 24 ‚Üí **Alabama covers**
- Margin: 24 - 27.5 = -3.5 ‚Üí No bonus (under 11)
- Winner: Alabama, Bonus: 0, Base: 20

**Example 2: Away Team Covers with Bonus**
- Game: USC @ Notre Dame
- Final: 14-38 (Notre Dame)
- Spread: Notre Dame -17.5
- Calculation: 38 + (-17.5) = 20.5 > 14 ‚Üí **Notre Dame covers**
- Margin: 20.5 - 14 = 6.5 ‚Üí Wait, this is WRONG!

Actually the correct calculation:
- Home score with spread: 38 + (-17.5) = 20.5
- If 20.5 > 14 (away score), home team covers
- Cover margin for home: 20.5 - 14 = 6.5 points
- Bonus: 0 (under 11 points)

**Example 3: Push**
- Game: Texas @ Oklahoma
- Final: 27-24 (Texas)
- Spread: Oklahoma -3.0
- Calculation: 24 + (-3.0) = 21 < 27 ‚Üí Texas covers
- Wait, that's not a push...

Let me recalculate:
- Home (Oklahoma) score with spread: 24 + (-3) = 21
- Away (Texas) score: 27
- 21 < 27, so Texas (away) covers
- NOT a push

**Push Example**:
- Game: Michigan @ Ohio State
- Final: 27-24 (Michigan)
- Spread: Ohio State -3.0
- Calculation: 24 + (-3) = 21 vs 27 away score
- 21 ‚â† 27, so NOT a push

A real push would be:
- Final: 27-24 (Michigan)
- Spread: Michigan -3.0 (home team favored)
- Home with spread: 24 + 3 = 27
- 27 = 27 ‚Üí **PUSH**

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If issues occur, you can temporarily revert by:

1. **Disable Edge Function automation** (stop cron jobs)
2. **Use manual admin scoring only** (which already uses database function)
3. **Investigate logs** to see what went wrong
4. **Fix and redeploy**

The manual admin fix will ALWAYS work because it uses the same database function!

---

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **All completed games score correctly** (matches manual calculation)
‚úÖ **No more incorrect winner assignments**
‚úÖ **Picks automatically processed** when games complete
‚úÖ **Edge Function logs show database winner** calculation
‚úÖ **Manual admin fix and auto-scoring produce identical results**
‚úÖ **No duplicate scoring logic** exists in codebase

## Questions & Troubleshooting

**Q: What if a game still scores incorrectly?**
A: Check the database function logs. The detailed `RAISE NOTICE` statements show every step of the calculation. If the database function is wrong, we fix it ONCE and it applies everywhere.

**Q: Can I still manually fix games?**
A: Yes! The admin dashboard should call the same `calculate_and_update_completed_game()` function.

**Q: What if picks don't update?**
A: The `process_picks_for_completed_game()` function is called within `calculate_and_update_completed_game()`. Check if there's an error in the pick processing step.

**Q: How do I know if the database function is being used?**
A: Check the logs - you'll see `üéØ Calling database to calculate winner and process picks...` followed by the result.
