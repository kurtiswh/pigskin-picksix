-- Migration 087: Fix trigger to handle NULL api_clock and api_period gracefully
-- 
-- ISSUE: API returns NULL for api_clock and api_period after games complete
-- PROBLEM: Triggers may be conflicting with NULL values during completion
-- ERROR: Manual completion queries error out when trying to set status='completed'
-- SOLUTION: Make triggers more robust and handle NULL values properly
