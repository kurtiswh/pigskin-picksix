-- Migration 133: Add Payment Filtering to Leaderboard Views
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Only show paid users on public leaderboards
-- CHANGES: 
--   1. Filter weekly_leaderboard to only show users with payment status = 'Paid'
--   2. Filter season_leaderboard to only show users with payment status = 'Paid'
--   3. Unpaid users will be tracked in Pick Management admin section instead
--
-- BENEFIT: When you mark a user as "Paid" in leaguesafe_payments, they automatically appear on leaderboards
