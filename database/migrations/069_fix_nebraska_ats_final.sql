-- This must be run in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor to bypass RLS policies
-- Game: Nebraska 20 - Cincinnati 17, Spread: Nebraska -6.5
-- ATS Winner: Cincinnati (Nebraska failed to cover 6.5 point spread)

-- Step 1: Verify current game state
SELECT

    away_team || ' @ ' || home_team as matchup,
    away_score || ' - ' || home_score as final_score,

    margin_bonus,
    status
FROM games 
WHERE id = '81ae6301-304f-4860-a890-ac3aacf556ef';

-- Step 2: Ensure games table is correct (Cincinnati should be ATS winner)
UPDATE games 
SET 
    winner_against_spread = 'CINCINNATI',

    base_points = 20,
    margin_bonus = 0

-- Step 3: Check current wrong picks state

-- Step 4: Disable triggers to prevent interference
ALTER TABLE picks DISABLE TRIGGER ALL;

-- Step 5: Fix Cincinnati picks (should WIN with 20 points)
UPDATE picks

-- Step 6: Fix Nebraska picks (should LOSE with 0 points)
UPDATE picks

    updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE game_id = '81ae6301-304f-4860-a890-ac3aacf556ef'
  AND selected_team = 'NEBRASKA';

-- Step 7: Re-enable triggers
ALTER TABLE picks ENABLE TRIGGER ALL;

-- Step 8: IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION (this should show correct results)
SELECT 
    'AFTER FIX - Picks should now be correct:' as info,
    selected_team,
    COUNT(*) as pick_count,

WHERE game_id = '81ae6301-304f-4860-a890-ac3aacf556ef'

-- Step 9: Force leaderboard recalculation by updating affected users
UPDATE picks 
SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
