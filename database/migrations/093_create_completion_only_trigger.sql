-- Migration 093: Create COMPLETION-ONLY trigger that prevents premature scoring
-- 
-- SOLUTION: Trigger that ONLY fires when status changes from non-completed to completed
-- DESIGN: No calculations during live updates, only when game actually finishes
-- GOAL: Eliminate competing processes that cause timeout and premature scoring
