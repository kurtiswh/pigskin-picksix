-- Migration 132: Fix Mixed User Leaderboard Display
-- 
-- PURPOSE: Allow users with both authenticated and anonymous picks to show both on leaderboards
-- ISSUE: Users like Elizabeth Kreeb have authenticated picks (Week 1) AND anonymous picks (Week 2)
--        but current logic excludes ALL anonymous picks if ANY authenticated picks exist
-- FIX: Change exclusion logic to be more granular - allow both sources to display separately
