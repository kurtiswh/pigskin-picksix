-- Migration 085: Fix proper game completion flow
-- 
-- CORRECT FLOW:
-- 1. Live scores update: points, period, clock (no scoring calculations)
-- 2. Game completes: status='completed' + calculate winner_against_spread + margin_bonus
-- 3. THEN: Update picks table based on completed game data
--
-- PROBLEM WITH CURRENT SYSTEM:
-- - Trigger runs on EVERY update (even live score updates)
-- - Should only calculate scoring when game actually completes
-- - Pick updates should happen AFTER game scoring is finalized
