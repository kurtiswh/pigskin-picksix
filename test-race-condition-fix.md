# Race Condition Fix Test Plan

## üéØ What We Fixed
- **Problem**: Multiple services calculating `winner_against_spread` simultaneously
- **Root Cause**: `liveUpdateService.ts` and `cfbdLiveUpdater.ts` both calculating winners
- **Solution**: Made CFBD Live Updater the single source of truth

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. **liveUpdateService.ts** - Removed Competing Calculation
```typescript
// OLD: Called database function to calculate winner
const { data: winnerData, error: winnerError } = await supabase
  .rpc('calculate_game_winner_and_bonus', {...})

// NEW: Skip winner calculation entirely
console.log(`üö® AVOIDING RACE CONDITION: Skipping database winner calculation`)
console.log(`üìç CFBD Live Updater handles winner calculation exclusively`)
```

### 2. **cfbdLiveUpdater.ts** - Enhanced Conflict Detection
```typescript
// Added race condition detection logging
if (dbGame.winner_against_spread) {
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT DETECTED: ${dbGame.home_team} already has winner: ${dbGame.winner_against_spread}`)
  console.log(`üîç This suggests competing calculation paths are still active!`)
}
```

### 3. **Pick Processing** - Moved to Single Authority
- Picks now processed immediately after CFBD sets winner
- Eliminates timing issues between winner calculation and pick scoring

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Check Current Winner Consistency
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Open browser console (F12)
3. Run: `checkWinnerConsistency()`
4. **Expected**: All games should show as "CORRECT"

### Test 2: Monitor Race Condition Logs
1. Watch console during live updates
2. Look for: `‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT DETECTED` messages
3. **Expected**: Should not see any conflict messages

### Test 3: Test Push Game Calculations
1. Run: `checkWinnerConsistency()` 
2. Look for games like Louisville-James Madison
3. **Expected**: Push games should be correctly identified

### Test 4: Verify Single Source Authority
1. Check logs during game completion
2. Look for: `‚úÖ AUTHORITATIVE WINNER SET`
3. **Expected**: Only CFBD Live Updater sets winners

## üîç Expected Results

‚úÖ **No more competing calculations**  
‚úÖ **Push games (Louisville) correctly scored**  
‚úÖ **Iowa-Iowa State type issues eliminated**  
‚úÖ **Manual corrections no longer overwritten**  

## üìä Monitoring Commands

### Browser Console (Admin Dashboard)
```javascript
// Check for inconsistent winners
checkWinnerConsistency()

// Fix any incorrect winners found
checkWinnerConsistency(true)

// Fix specific problem games
fixIncorrectGames()
```

## üö® Warning Signs

If you see these in logs, race conditions may still exist:
- `‚ö†Ô∏è CONFLICT DETECTED` - Multiple calculations detected
- Inconsistent winners in `checkWinnerConsistency()`
- Manual corrections being reverted

## üéâ Success Criteria

1. **Zero conflicts detected** in consistency checker
2. **No competing winner calculations** in logs  
3. **Push games scored correctly** (10 points each)
4. **Manual corrections persist** (not overwritten)
