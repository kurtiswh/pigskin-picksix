-- Comprehensive fix for picks table RLS policies

-- First, let's check the current state
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'picks';
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'picks';

-- Drop ALL existing policies to start fresh
DO $$ 
DECLARE 
    r RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR r IN (SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'picks') LOOP
        EXECUTE 'DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "' || r.policyname || '" ON public.picks';
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Create very permissive policies for authenticated users
-- These allow authenticated users to do anything with picks
CREATE POLICY "authenticated_full_picks_access" ON public.picks
    FOR ALL 
    TO authenticated
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Also allow anonymous access for the direct API calls to work
-- This might be needed if the auth context isn't properly passed
CREATE POLICY "anon_full_picks_access" ON public.picks
    FOR ALL 
    TO anon
    USING (true)
    WITH CHECK (true);

-- Verify RLS is enabled
ALTER TABLE public.picks ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Check the final state
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'picks';
SELECT policyname, cmd, roles, qual FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'picks';
